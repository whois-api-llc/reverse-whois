# Using the Reverse Whois API web service

[Reverse Whois API](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-api.php) 
is used to search for domain records based on particular search terms such as
name, email, phone, address, etc. that are usually part of Whois records.
Query results will consist of all the domain records that correspond
with the search terms used.

Here you'll find examples of using the API implemented in multiple languages.

You'll need a
[WhoisXmlApi account](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/user/create.php) to
authenticate.

Please, refer to the
[Reverse Whois API User Guide](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-api-guide.php)
for info on input parameters, request/response formats, authentication
instructions and more.
